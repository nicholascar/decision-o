A complex process that starts with a question and may result in indication of a solution for the underlying problem. It is important to note that a decision-making is something substantially different than decision, which is an output of the process of deciding. Usually it can be represented by the following pattern:
1. Decision-making starts with a question which is an utterance of some problem
2. The decider gathers and analyzes some information
3. The decider evaluates possible options (under some criteria).
4. One of the options may get recognized as the right/appropriate/best possible solution for the initial question/problem or the decider may choose to restrain from choice. What justifies this act could be an objective evaluation of clearly defined criteria but also an intuition, emotion or other subjective factor.

In most cases stages 2-3 consist of many (concurrent or sequential) actions, events, processes related to information gathering, processing, verifying etc. In some cases a decision-making can be viewed as a complex process involving many sub-decisions preceding the recognition of the initial problem solution. In our current work we have focused on the basic elements of the above pattern (the question, gathering information, considering options, choosing solution). It should be considered to what extent this ontology should support the modeling of correlated issues such as: information verification and retrieval etc."""@en ;

Option has always related criteria which correspond to requirements, recommendations,obligations etc. Those criteria might be implied from some documents, agreements, formal regulations etc. but also from subjective preferences or feelings. For example choosing a car may have a criterion related to subjective color or brand preferneces.

TODO: A set of entities for representing the criteria "source" may be a valuable addition to Decision-O, but it will require modeling a new set of concepts related to subjective phenomena like attitudes, preferences, emotions, intutions etc."""@en ;
